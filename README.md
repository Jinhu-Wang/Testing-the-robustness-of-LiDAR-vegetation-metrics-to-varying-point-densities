# Testing-the-robustness-of-LiDAR-vegetation-metrics-to-varying-point-densities

This repository consists of the scripts performing the computation and plotting of the results.

## [1_Generate_plots_from_centroids_R]
This folder holds the R scripts employed to create polygons for randomly placed plots of different sizes.

## [2_Compute_vegetation_metrics_C++]
This folder contains the C++ source codes that compute the vegetation metrics. The source codes are organized by a VS2022 project. 

## [3_Plotting_metrics_Python]
This folder consists of the Python scripts used for plotting boxplots of the computed vegetation metrics for various plot sizes and point densities.
